/**
 * Cognito PreTokenGeneration trigger.
 *
 * Stamps the user's `memberships` onto the ID token from their USER# record, so
 * authorization (tenant + role + clubIds) travels in the token instead of being a
 * fixed Cognito attribute. Because it reads the DB on every token mint/refresh,
 * role changes and rep handovers take effect by editing the USER# item — no
 * attribute migration. See docs/architecture/0003.
 *
 * Claims must be strings, so `memberships` is JSON-encoded; the API and SPA decode it.
